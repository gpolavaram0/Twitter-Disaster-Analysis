# Background
The main objective of this project is to explore the machine learning, NLP techniques and combined with our other data analytical tools to analyze disaster tweets. Decided to partake in the Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets Kaggle competition aimed at producing an accurate model for tweet analysis. Our model will determine the authenticity of these disaster tweets.
Major Objective: Accurate classification of tweets as either discussing disasters or not. 


# Data Sources
Initial csv files were imported from Kaggle database and stored in our github data folder; Data/manually_cleaned/

•	sample_submisstion.csv

•	test.csv

•	train.csv

•	train_ready.csv(Cleaned Data)

# Technique/Technology

•	Data cleaning by using Regex in Python
•	Stored in AWS bucket
•	Google Colab for model creation and testing
•	Pyspark for creation of classification models and model testing
•	Naïve Bayes
•	Random Forest
•	Logistic Regression
•	SVC
•	MNB
•	SGDC
