# Data Sources
Initial csv files were imported from Kaggle database and stored in our github data folder; Data/manually_cleaned/
•	sample_submisstion.csv
•	test.csv
•	train.csv
•	train_ready.csv(Cleaned Data)

# Technique/Technology
*Python/Pandas, was used to initial cleaning and visualizing the data. Pyspark was used for data categorization purpose.
